# The-Void
I used this app to get familiar with databases in android. What the app does is allow for a user to make tweet-like statuses that are locked for 24 hours. What that means is that they can't touch what they wrote until 24 hours have passed. This way one could vent to "The Void" and then come back at a later time when they feel more "normal" and then delete the status without ever making it go online. If they decide the status is still important, they can then share it to facebook, twitter, or their clipboard.
